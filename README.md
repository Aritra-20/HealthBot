# HealthBot


The user can choose from the 4 services that the bot has. On choosing the services like “Covid-19”, “File an insurance claim” and “Provider lookup”, the bot will take some inputs from the user and resolve the problem. This eliminates the immediate need for a consultant or contacting an employee from the hospitals etc. There is another service taht i have created with the help of Azure SQL Database and Logic Apps called “hospital check-in” where the user needs to give his/her inputs like name, age, height, weight and symptoms they are having and the health-bot will automatically create a check-in for the user in the hospital, this eliminates the purpose of having a receptionist. If the bot is unable to find out the probable disease and cure it will prompt the user to consult a doctor or book an appointment for the same. Ultimately the user will be able to get an overview of how vulnerable situation he/she is in and take precautionary measures for the meantime. As a result, this will help the user to save their valuable time and money and take necessary actions.
